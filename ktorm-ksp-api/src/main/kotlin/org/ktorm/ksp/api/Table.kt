/**
 * The specified class is an entity, and ksp will generate the corresponding [org.ktorm.schema.Table] or [BaseTable]
 * object This class can be an interface based on [Entity] and will generate [org.ktorm.schema.Table] objects.
 * It can also be a normal class/data class that will generate a [BaseTable] object
 *
 * For the above two different entity classes, the generated Table will also be different.
 * Among them, the [BaseTable] object generated based on the class will generate the [BaseTable.createEntity] method
 * implementation by default. And based on the [Entity] interface implementation [org.ktorm.schema.Table] does not
 * generate an implementation of this method. The generated column property definitions are also different.
 * For details, please refer to the description in [Column].
 *
 * By default, the class name of [BaseTable] or [org.ktorm.schema.Table] is generated, and the plural of nouns
 * is converted based on the class name. The generated class name can be modified by assigning the [tableClassName]
 * property
